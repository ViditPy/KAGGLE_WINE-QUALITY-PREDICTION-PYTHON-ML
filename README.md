KAGGLE_WINE QUALITY PREDICTION PYTHON/ML
### Wine Quality Prediction

**Objective :** To try to predict the quality of the wine with the help of features provided.
For this project we will be using the following UCI dataset- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine
The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

Here are the features represented through columns :
<br>
**Input variables (based on physicochemical tests)**

1 - fixed acidity
<br>
2 - volatile acidity
<br>
3 - citric acid
<br>
4 - residual sugar
<br>
5 - chlorides
<br>
6 - free sulfur dioxide
<br>
7 - total sulfur dioxide
<br>
8 - density
<br>
9 - pH
<br>
10 - sulphates
<br>
11 - alcohol

**Output variable (based on sensory data)**

12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
